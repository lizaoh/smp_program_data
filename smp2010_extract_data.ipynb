              "['(Session B) **Movement Planning under Risk, Decision Making under Risk.** Larry Maloney _NYU_ . In executing any speeded movement, there is uncertainty about the outcome due to motor variability. I’ll describe recent experiments in which subjects carried out speeded motor tasks that were equivalent to economic decisions. The outcome of each movement earned an explicit monetary reward or penalty. In one game, for example, subjects attempted to reach out and touch briefly presented reward disks while avoiding nearby, overlapping penalty disks. The task for the subject was to trade off the risk of missing the reward disk against the risk of hitting the penalty disk. The optimum tradeoff depended on the magnitudes of penalty and reward and the subject’s own motor error. For each subject, in each game, we could estimate the ideal movement strategy and maximum expected gain possible. We compared subjects’ movements and winnings to this ideal. In many of these experiments, subjects consistently chose movements that were close to optimal. This outcome is surprising: these motor tasks are, after all, formally equivalent to decision making under risk and subjects making decisions under risk typically do not maximize expected gain. I’ll describe very recent work in which we set out to translate classical decision making experiments (concerning the independence axiom of expected utility theory) into motor form and compare decision making under risk to movement planning under risk in the same subjects.',\n",
              " '(Session B) **Recent Developments in Nonparametric Bayesian Inference.** Mike Jordan _UC_ \\n\\n_Berkeley_ . Bayesian inference is often viewed as an assumption-laden approach to statistical inference, whereby strong assumptions about existing knowledge are imposed in order to support the acquisition of new knowledge from data. The past two decades have seen the development of an increasingly vigorous field of Bayesian nonparametrics, which simultaneously provides a more expressive language for prior knowledge and allows for weaker specifications. Mathematically, Bayesian nonparametrics amounts to using general stochastic processes as prior distributions. I discuss a class of stochastic processes known as “completely random measures” that I view as providing particularly useful building blocks for Bayesian nonparametrics. I will discuss applications of models based on completely random measures to several problem domains, including natural language processing, protein structural modeling, computational vision, and statistical genetics.']"

I’ll describe recent experiments in which subjects carried out speeded motor tasks that were equivalent to economic decisions. The outcome of each movement earned an explicit monetary reward or penalty. In one game, for example, subjects attempted to reach out and touch briefly presented reward disks while avoiding nearby, overlapping penalty disks. The task for the subject was to trade off the risk of missing the reward disk against the risk of hitting the penalty disk. The optimum tradeoff depended on the magnitudes of penalty and reward and the subject’s own motor error. For each subject, in each game, we could estimate the ideal movement strategy and maximum expected gain possible. We compared subjects’ movements and winnings to this ideal. In many of these experiments, subjects consistently chose movements that were close to optimal. This outcome is surprising: these motor tasks are, after all, formally equivalent to decision making under risk and subjects making decisions under risk typically do not maximize expected gain. I’ll describe very recent work in which we set out to translate classical decision making experiments (concerning the independence axiom of expected utility theory) into motor form and compare decision making under risk to movement planning under risk in the same subjects.'},\n",

The past two decades have seen the development of an increasingly vigorous field of Bayesian nonparametrics, which simultaneously provides a more expressive language for prior knowledge and allows for weaker specifications. Mathematically, Bayesian nonparametrics amounts to using general stochastic processes as prior distributions. I discuss a class of stochastic processes known as “completely random measures” that I view as providing particularly useful building blocks for Bayesian nonparametrics. I will discuss applications of models based on completely random measures to several problem domains, including natural language processing, protein structural modeling, computational vision, and statistical genetics.'},\n",

Successfully solving inductive problems of this kind requires having good “inductive biases” – constraints that guide inductive inference. Viewed abstractly, understanding human learning requires identifying these inductive biases and exploring their origins. I will argue that probabilistic models of cognition provide a framework that can facilitate this project, giving a transparent characterization of the inductive biases of ideal learners. I will discuss three ways in which these models can be used to shedlight on human inductive biases: comparing predictions, assessing learnability, and designing experimental methods that magnify the effects of inductive biases.'}]"

Matrix multiplication has been thought of as neurally plausible due to its similarity to learning in connectionist networks and being viewed as plausibly carried out by the circuitry within the hippocampus; this has been used to push convolution-based models on the back burner as neurally implausible (Pike, 1984). A recent surprising finding \\u201cgrid cells\\u201d in medial entorhinal cortex (Hafting et al., 2005), a major input to the hippocampus appear to form a 2D spatial Fourier basis set for a place representation thought to be held within the hippocampus (Solstad et al., 2006). Fourier transform is a well known mathematical shortcut to compute convolutions in _O_ ( _n_ log( _n_ )) (Brigham, 1974). I suggest that the grid-cell finding tells us that the hippocampus carries out spatial, as well as non-spatial associative learning via convolution (in addition to or conceivably instead of matrix multiplication), supporting the neural plausibility of convolution-based memory models and potentially explaining how the hippocampus implements associative symmetry (Bunsey and Eichenbaum, 1996), a property of convolutionbased models wherein there is no directionality stored within associations (Asch and Ebenholtz, 1962). This insight suggests that hippocampal modelers may need to consider convolution as a computational function of the hippocampalentorhinal pathway, and may help explain the pattern of association-memory impairments in medial temporal lobe amnesia.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
