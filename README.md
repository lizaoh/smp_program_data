# Scripts for getting program data for SMP conferences
`program_extraction_scripts` contains scripts for each year for extracting author, affiliation, title, and abstracts (if possible) for the talks/posters.

`create_abstract_docs_scripts` contains scripts for creating and writing the Google Doc for each talk/poster's abstract using Google Drive API. This is currently for making the documents one-by-one. I used [Jie Jenn's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K2P2bWEd90&list=PL3JVwFmb_BnTamTxXbmlwpspYdpmaHdbz) as a guide/template.
