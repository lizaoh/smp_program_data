After laying out the foundation, I will show how these flexible techniques\\nare ideally suited for carrying out computation in sophisticated probabilistic models of\\ncognition. In particular, I will show how they can be used to learn models with time-\\nvarying properties, unknown number of variables, and (possibly unknown) complex\\nrelational and hierarchical structures. I will also show how these methods can be used\\nto attack problems in stochastic decision making, such as active learning,\\nexperimental design, optimal control and sequential Markov decision processes.',\n",
              " \"Presenter:  Lawrence DeCarlo \\nPresentation type:  Talk \\nPresentation date/time:  7/26  9:00-9:25 \\n  \\nOn Some Mixture SDT Models for Associative-\\nRecognition \\n  \\nLawrence DeCarlo, Teachers College, Columbia University\\n \\n  \\nParticipants in associative-recognition tasks are shown word pairs to study, and later,\\nin a test, are shown intact or re-arranged word pairs. Mixture SDT models for\\nassociative-recognition tasks can be motivated by considering the effects of attention\\non each trial, as has previously been done for recognition memory, source recognition,\\nand the mirror effect. It is shown that a mixture SDT model proposed for source\\nrecognition tasks (DeCarlo, 2003) can be applied to associative-recognition tasks. A \\nunique aspect of the associative-recognition task is that re-arranged word pairs consist \\nof two words, either or both of which might provide some associative information -\\neven if one doesn't remember the word pair (or the pair is not familiar), one may feel\\nconfident that one of the words was not paired with the other. Thus, in the model\\npresented here, re-arranged word pairs are viewed as providing associative\\ninformation. Analysis of recent data suggests that there is indeed associative strength\\nfor re-arranged word pairs, but it appears to be smaller than that for intact pairs. The\\nuse of new-word pairs, or lures, also raises some interesting questions. For example,\\nnew word pairs in associative-recognition tasks might provide information about\\nassociation: if one is confident that a word is new, then one can also be confident that\\nit was not in a previously presented word pair. Models that incorporate lures and other\\nextensions are considered.\"]"

After laying out the foundation, I will show how these flexible techniques are ideally suited for carrying out computation in sophisticated probabilistic models of cognition. In particular, I will show how they can be used to learn models with time-varying properties, unknown number of variables, and (possibly unknown) complex relational and hierarchical structures. I will also show how these methods can be used to attack problems in stochastic decision making, such as active learning, experimental design, optimal control and sequential Markov decision processes.'},\n",

              "  'abstract': \"Participants in associative-recognition tasks are shown word pairs to study, and later, in a test, are shown intact or re-arranged word pairs. Mixture SDT models for associative-recognition tasks can be motivated by considering the effects of attention on each trial, as has previously been done for recognition memory, source recognition, and the mirror effect. It is shown that a mixture SDT model proposed for source recognition tasks (DeCarlo, 2003) can be applied to associative-recognition tasks. A unique aspect of the associative-recognition task is that re-arranged word pairs consist of two words, either or both of which might provide some associative information -even if one doesn't remember the word pair (or the pair is not familiar), one may feel confident that one of the words was not paired with the other. Thus, in the model presented here, re-arranged word pairs are viewed as providing associative information. Analysis of recent data suggests that there is indeed associative strength for re-arranged word pairs, but it appears to be smaller than that for intact pairs. The use of new-word pairs, or lures, also raises some interesting questions. For example, new word pairs in associative-recognition tasks might provide information about association: if one is confident that a word is new, then one can also be confident that it was not in a previously presented word pair. Models that incorporate lures and other extensions are considered.\"}]"

Using a multivariate approach we assessed the joint effects of reaction time and interference on oscillatory power. These analyses revealed significant and distinct electrophysiological correlates of proactive interference and similarity-based interference. For faces, trials with high proactive interference yielded increased occipital gamma oscillations. Gratings did not exhibit behavioral or electrophysiological proactive interference effects, but an electrophysiological correlate of lag instead. Trials with high similarity-based interference yielded decreased low frequency (2-8 Hz) oscillations for both stimulus types. The marked differences in the electrophysiological correlates of the two types of interference, even when controlling for accuracy and RT differences, lends support to theories that posit separate informational dimensions for temporal and similarity based information (e.g., Brown, Neath, and Chater (in preparation)).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
