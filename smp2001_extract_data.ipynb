Modern\\nvariants of classical chaining theory provide an adequate ﬁt to these data (e.g.,\\nLewandowsky and Murdock, 1989). The averaging of data that produces these functions\\nobscures the detailed history of individual items over the course of study-test trials.\\nExtending Tulving's (1964) analysis of free recall learning, we present a new analysis of\\nserial learning that tracks the acquisition and forgetting of item and order information, at the\\nlevel of individual items. Applying this analysis to a large data set on serial list learning we\\nshow that several variants of chaining theory fail to capture the gains and losses of item and\\norder information over trials. These models do, however, provide a nice ﬁt to serial position\\ncurves and their change over trials. These ﬁndings suggest that an elaborated analysis of\\nlearning data,such as the one we present, places strong constraints on theories of order\\nmemory.\\n\",\n",

Ahumada, Jr. NASA Ames Research Center\\nNorman Anderson developed functional measurement to jointly assign scale values to\\nobjects and a transformation that allows those scale values to be combined additively to\\npredict their effectiveness. John Foley has developed a theory of visual masking that has the\\nfunctional measurement form for the effectiveness of masking stimuli at increasing the\\nthreshold for the detection of targets, but the additive components relate to unobservable\\nstimulus channels, so we have been estimating all the parameters in the context of speciﬁc\\nmodels. If the additive masking effects are proportional to the variance of channel activity,\\nthe Foley masking combination rule can be applied in the stimulus domain and the\\nfunctional measurement gives the additive scale values for the maskers and the combination\\nfunction. This analysis is demonstrated for experiments in which different color masks have\\nbeen added together and their masking effect has been measured both separately and in\\ncombination. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the masking is additive in\\nproportion to the variance of channel activity. The directions in color space of the underlying\\nchannels are not identiﬁable from this analysis. Other linear combinations of the channels\\n',\n",

Modern variants of classical chaining theory provide an adequate fit to these data (e.g., Lewandowsky and Murdock, 1989). The averaging of data that produces these functions obscures the detailed history of individual items over the course of study-test trials. Extending Tulving's (1964) analysis of free recall learning, we present a new analysis of serial learning that tracks the acquisition and forgetting of item and order information, at the level of individual items. Applying this analysis to a large data set on serial list learning we show that several variants of chaining theory fail to capture the gains and losses of item and order information over trials. These models do, however, provide a nice fit to serial position curves and their change over trials. These findings suggest that an elaborated analysis of learning data,such as the one we present, places strong constraints on theories of order memory.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
